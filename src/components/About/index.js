                    I was born in Calgary, Alberta Canada. I moved to Utah with his family in 2005.
                    I enjoys a variety of outdoor activities including: dirt-biking, mountain biking, snowboarding, skiing and longboarding.
                    Mitchellâ€™s biggest passion is dirt-biking.
                    I began riding at the age of 3 and has never stopped.
                    I likes living in Utah because of the many opportunities it gives him to enjoy these activities year round.
                    Mitchell is a hard worker and has a great ability to learn new skills quickly.
                    I is able to get along with others easily and is very good at teaching and helping others learn new skills.
